Transformers have grown larger [ 5] and deeper [ 83], but\nequipping them with longer context remains diﬃcult [ 80], since the self-attention module at their heart\nhas time and memory complexity quadratic in sequence length. An important question is whether making\nattention faster and more memory-eﬃcient can help Transformer models address their runtime and memory\nchallenges for long sequences.\nMany approximate attention methods have aimed to reduce the compute and memory requirements of\nattention. These methods range from sparse-approximation [ 51,74] to low-rank approximation [ 12,50,84],', 'the model’s performance on tasks that require re-\ncalling minutiae information over very long con-\ntexts. This is due to the funneling of informa-\ntion through a single vector representation over\nmany time steps, compared with the full informa-\ntion maintained by the quadratic attention of stan-\ndard Transformers. In other words, the model’s\nrecurrent architecture inherently limits its ability to\n“look back” at previous tokens, as opposed to tra-\nditional self-attention mechanisms. While learned\ntime decay helps prevent the loss of information,\nit is mechanistically limited compared to full self-\nattention.\nAnother limitation of this work is the increased\nimportance of prompt engineering in comparison to\nstandard Transformer models. The linear attention\nmechanism used in RWKV limits the information\nfrom the prompt that will be carried over to the\nmodel’s continuation. As a result, carefully de-\nsigned prompts may be even more crucial for the\nmodel to perform well on tasks.', 'between any two positions in the network.

While we evaluate the pre-trained model\nhere for fairness and toxicity along certain axes, it is possible that these biases can have varied downstream\nimpacts depending on how the model is used.

For instance, BERT-PKD (Sun et al., 2019)\nis a patient knowledge distillation approach that compresses the original BERT model into a lightweight\nshallow network. Different from traditional knowledge distillation methods, BERT-PKD enables an\nexploitation of rich information in the teacher’s hidden layers by utilizing a layer-wise distillation con-\nstraint. DistillBERT (Sanh et al., 2019) pre-trains a smaller general-purpose language model on the\nsame corpus as vanilla BERT. Distilled BiLSTM (Tang et al., 2019) adopts a single-layer BiLSTM as\nthe student model and achieves comparable results with ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) through much fewer\nparameters and less inference time. TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2019) exploits a novel attention-based distil-\nlation schema that encourages the linguistic knowledge in teacher to be well transferred into the student', '4.5 Combination with Knowledge Distillation\nKnowledge distillation is a popular technique to improve the performance of small models (Romero\net al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2015). In knowledge distillation, the small model (student) is trained to\nmimic the output of a larger fine-tuned model (teacher) such that the performance of the small\nmodel can be improved.\nWe remark that compression methods are complementary to knowledge distillation. We show\nit by integrating knowledge distillation into LoSparse and other pruning methods. Specifically,\nwe choose a DeBERTaV3-base model that is fine-tuned on specific tasks as the teacher model\nand a compressed DeBERTaV3-base model as the student model. Then we conduct layer-wise\ndistillation for them. Please see Appendix E for more training details. Table 5 shows the results.\nWe find that distillation can further improve the performance of LoSparse and other compression', 'Table 4: Ablation study.

Drawing on proven experiences\nfrom these domains to improve the assessment of MLLM hallucination, or unifying them into an\noverall framework, may be promising research directions.\n6.3 Advancements in Model Architecture', 'Data quality relevant to hallucinations can be further categorized into the following three facets.\n•Noisy data. As mentioned in the definition section, training MLLMs involves two stages. The\npre-training stage employs image-text pairs crawled from the web, which contain inaccurate,\nmisaligned, or corrupted data samples. The noisy data would limit the cross-modal feature\nalignment [ 117,120], which serves as the foundation of MLLMs. As for the instruction tuning\ndata, prevalent methods, such as LLaVA [ 75], utilize the advanced GPT-4 [ 82] model to\ngenerate instructions. However, ChatGPT is a language model that cannot interpret visual\ncontent, leading to the risk of noisy data. Moreover, language models themselves suffer\nfrom the issue of hallucination [ 44], further increasing the risk.

Figure.14 presents\na schematic representation of the different training stages involved in the development of efficient\nMLLMs. In the following subsections, we delve deeper into each of these aspects and discuss their\nsignificance in the context of efficient MLLMs.\n5.1 Pre-Training\nIn the pre-training stage, the primary focus is on aligning different modalities in the embedding\nspace, enabling the language model to accept inputs from various modalities. This phase of training\nmainly involves large-scale text-paired data, predominantly in the form of image-caption pairs. An\nimage-caption pair (X, Y )is typically expanded into a single-turn conversation (Xinstruct , Xa),\nwhere Xinstruct contains an image Xvand a randomly sampled question Xqfrom a set of instruc-', 'sequences. Moreover, XPOSoptimizes attention resolution so that the position information can\nbe captured more precisely. The method XPOSis efﬁcient and effective in both interpolation and\nextrapolation settings.\n2.3 Training Objective\nTheKOSMOS -1training is conducted on web-scale multimodal corpora, including monomodal data\n(e.g., text corpus), cross-modal paired data (e.g., image-caption pairs), and interleaved multimodal\ndata (e.g., documents of arbitrarily interleaved images and texts). To be speciﬁc, we use monomodal\ndata for representation learning. For example, language modeling with text data pretrains instruction\nfollowing, in-context learning, and various language tasks. Moreover, cross-modal pairs and inter-\nleaved data learn to align the perception of general modalities with language models.

They believe this method\ncan also efficiently and cost-effectively evaluate RAG-based\napplications.\nIn the field of RAG evaluation frameworks, RAGAS and\nARES are relatively new. The core focus of these evaluations\nis on three main metrics: Faithfulness of the answer, answer\nrelevance, and context relevance. Additionally, TruLens, an\nopen-source library proposed by the industry, also offers a', 'model-based approach [729]. Table 15 shows an illustration\nof the relationship among LLM type, evaluation approach,\nand tested abilities. Next, we will discuss the evaluation\napproaches for different types of LLMs.\nEvaluation of Base LLMs. Base LLMs refer to the model\ncheckpoints obtained right after pre-training. For base\nLLMs, we mainly focus on examining the basic abilities\n(Section 7.1), such as complex reasoning and knowledge\nutilization. Since most of these basic abilities can be assessed\nwith well-defined tasks, benchmark-based approaches have\nbeen widely used to evaluate base LLMs. Next, we will\nintroduce common evaluation benchmarks and evaluation\nprocedures for base LLMs.\n•Common benchmarks. To evaluate base LLMs, typical\nbenchmarks are designed in the form of close-ended prob-\nlems like multiple-choice questions. These commonly used\nbenchmarks can be mainly divided into two categories:\nknowledge-oriented and reasoning-oriented benchmarks.', 'set of multi-turn questions for evaluation and improves the\nreliability of LLM-based evaluators through methods like\nICL and CoT. Compared with human evaluators, LLMs such\nas ChatGPT and GPT-4 can achieve high agreement with\nhumans, in both small-scale handcrafted and large-scale\ncrowdsourced evaluation tasks. Despite this, these closed-\nsource LLMs are limited in access and have the potential\nrisk of data leakage. To address this, recent work [727] has\nexplored fine-tuning open-source LLMs ( e.g., Vicuna [138])\nas model evaluators using scoring data from human eval-\nuators, which has narrowed the gap with powerful closed-\nsource LLMs ( e.g., GPT-4).\nEvaluation of Specialized LLMs. Specialized LLMs refer\nto the model checkpoints specially adapted to some do-\nmains or applications like healthcare [356] and finance [737].\nAs special task solvers, specialized LLMs will be tested\nnot only on general abilities ( e.g., basic ability like com-', 'and allows for a more thorough evaluation by covering\na wider range of evaluation aspects. To further improve\nthe quality of the single-model evaluation, recent studies\nalso develop multi-agent collaboration frameworks [893–\n895] or fine-tune LLMs as specified evaluators [371, 888–\n890, 896]. In a multi-model collaboration mode, different\nLLMs evaluate the candidates by engaging in discussions\nto align preferences and reach a consensus [894, 895]. This\nmethod helps reduce the potential biases in individual\nmodels through the consensus reached by multiple agents.\nAnother approach to improving single-model evaluation\nis to specialize LLMs as scores or critics through fine-\ntuning [371, 888–890, 896]. This process involves creating\ndatasets annotated with preferences and feedback from\nhumans or proficient LLMs. These datasets are then used to\ntrain evaluation-oriented models, enabling them to generate\npairwise preference or language feedback. The specialized', '68\non various abilities ( e.g., knowledge utilization and hu-\nman alignment), and thus it is common that they are as-\nsessed with multiple evaluation approaches. In addition\nto benchmark-based evaluation, human-based and model-\nbased approaches have also been widely used to evaluate\nthe advanced abilities of fine-tuned LLMs. Next, we will\nintroduce the two evaluation methods.\n•Human-based evaluation. Unlike automatic evaluation\nfor basic abilities, human evaluation typically considers\nmore factors or abilities in real-world use, such as hu-\nman alignment and tool manipulation. In this evaluation\napproach, test tasks are usually in the form of open-\nended questions, and human evaluators are invited to make\njudgments on the quality of answers generated by LLMs.\nTypically, there are two main types of scoring methods\nfor human evaluators: pairwise comparison and single-\nanswer grading. In pairwise comparison, given the same\nquestion, humans are assigned two answers from different']","['a05a21efce', '56b8ebf97f', '559acaf874', '766fb3e964', '3603224301']",crossencoder,text,1.0,1

Regarding hallucination, HallE-Switch [ 123] has investigated the impact\nof vision encoder resolution on its proposed CCEval benchmark. Among the three studied vision\nencoders (CLIP-ViT-L-112, CLIP-ViT-L-224, CLIP-ViT-L-336), higher resolution generally results\nin lower degrees of hallucination. These works indicate that scaling up vision resolution is a\nstraightforward yet effective solution.\n5.2.2 Versatile Vision Encoders. Several studies [ 38,49,98] have investigated vision encoders for\nMLLMs. Typically, the CLIP ViT image encoder is used as the vision encoder in most MLLMs\nthanks to its remarkable ability to extract semantic-rich features. However, CLIP has been shown\nto lose some visual details compared to pure vision models like DINO ViT [ 10]. Therefore, recent', 'to lose some visual details compared to pure vision models like DINO ViT [ 10]. Therefore, recent\nstudies have proposed complementing this information loss by incorporating visual features from\nother vision encoders. The work of [ 98] proposes mixing features from CLIP ViT and DINO ViT.\nSpecifically, it experimented with additive and interleaved features. Both settings show that there\nis a trade-off between the two types of features. A more dedicated mechanism is needed.\nConcurrently, a visual expert-based model proposed in [ 38] aims to mitigate the information\nloss caused by the CLIP image encoder. Instead of merely mixing features, this paper enhances\nthe visual perception ability of MLLMs by focusing on knowledge enhancement, relying on two\npivotal modules: multi-task encoders and the structural knowledge enhancement module. The multi-\ntask encoders are dedicated to integrating various types of latent visual information extracted by', 'prehension of visual data.

SPHINX-X[14] employs\ntwo vision encoders – DINOv2 and CLIP-ConvNeXt. Given that these models have been pre-trained\nvia distinct learning methodologies (self-supervised versus weakly supervised) and network archi-\ntectures (ViT versus CNN), they are naturally capable of offering the most complementary and\nsophisticated visual knowledge.\nLightweight Vision Encoder Vision Transformer architectures in real-world applications pose\nchallenges due to hardware and environmental limitations, including processing power and compu-\ntational capabilities.

This is essentially a visual content-guided decoding strategy.\nIn addition to token-level correction, HALC also incorporates a matching-based beam search that\nutilizes a visual matching score to steer the generation of the final outputs, balancing both object\nhallucination mitigation and text generation quality.\nOthers. The work of OPEAR [ 45] makes an interesting observation that most hallucinations\nare closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix,', 'Similarly, GCD [ 24] devises a CLIP-Guided Decoding (GCD) approach. It first verifies that\nCLIPScore [ 88] can effectively distinguish between hallucinated and non-hallucinated sentences\nthrough a series of studies across different models and datasets. Based on this conclusion, it further\nrecalibrates the decoding process of MLLMs, including two steps: 1) reliability scoring, which\ndesigns a (CLIP-based) scoring function aiming to assign higher scores to candidate responses that\nare less likely to be hallucinated, and 2) guided sentence generation, which generates responses\nbased on this scoring. This is implemented in a similar way to beam search but at the sentence\nlevel.\nHALC [ 15] provides a key insight that when decoding a specific token in the MLLM, identifying a\ntoken-wise optimal visual context to provide the most informative visual grounding can effectively\nreduce hallucination. Visual context refers to the visual tokens that can be grounded from the', 'nificant modality gap exists between textual and visual tokens, suggesting that the current learned\ninterfaces are not effective in mapping visual representations into the textual representation space of\nLLMs. This issue potentially exacerbates the tendency for MLLMs to generate more hallucinations.\nTherefore, HACL proposes enhancing the alignment between visual and textual representations\nthrough contrastive loss. Texts with hallucinations are used as hard negative examples for image\nanchors. The loss pulls representations of non-hallucinating text and visual samples closer while\npushing representations of non-hallucinating and hallucinative text apart. Experiment results show\nthat this method not only reduces hallucination but also enhances performance on other popular\nbenchmarks.\nRecalling the work of EOS Decision [ 120], to teach the model to terminate the generation process\nproperly, this work also designs a learning objective, termed Selective EOS Supervision, in addition', 'Hallucination of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey 19\nPreference Optimization (FDPO).

It extends the\nRLHF paradigm from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human\nannotators were asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the hallucinated one. The MLLM is\ntrained to maximize the human reward simulated by an reward model. To address the potential\nissue of reward hacking ,i.e.,achieving high scores from the reward model does not necessarily lead\nto improvement in human judgements, it proposes an algorithm named Factually Augmented RLHF.\nThis algorithm calibrates the reward signals by augmenting them with additional information such\nas image captions.', 'Hallucination of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey 21\n5.4.2 Post-hoc Correction.

This\ntechnique successfully modifies heavy-tailed activation distributions to fit a given quantizer.\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training cycle. This in-\ntegration is particularly advantageous when scaling down to ultra-low bit precision, such as 4 bits\nor lower, where PTQ struggles with significant performance loss. For example, Quantformer [124]\nleverages entropy information to maintain consistency in self-attention ranks and introduces a dif-\nferentiable search mechanism to optimally group patch feature dimensions, reducing rounding and\nclipping inaccuracies. Q-ViT [126] incorporates a distillation token and Information Rectification\nModule (IRM) to counteract altered distributions in quantized attention modules. TerViT [127] and\nBit-shrinking [125] progressively reduce model bit-width while regulating sharpness to maintain', '46\n•Fine-grained quantization . For Transformer models,\nweights and activations are usually represented in the\nform of tensors. A straightforward approach is to use\ncoarse-grained quantization parameters for the whole ten-\nsor ( i.e., per-tensor quantization) [414]. However, it usu-\nally leads to inaccurate reconstruction results. Thus, fine-\ngrained methods are proposed to reduce the quantization\nerror. ZeroQuant [415] adopts a token-wise quantization\napproach with dynamic calibration for compressing acti-\nvations. Whereas for weights (easier to be quantized), it\nuses a group-wise quantization. In practice, a group size\nof 128 [415, 416] is commonly used for model quantization.\n•Balancing the quantization difficulty . Considering that\nweights are easier to be quantized than activations,\nSmoothQuant [414] proposes to migrate the difficulty from\nactivations to weights. Specially, they incorporate a scaling\ntransformation to balance the difficulty between weights', 'Migrate the quantization difficulty from activations to\nweights. We aim to choose a per-channel smoothing factor\nssuch that ˆX=Xdiag(s)−1is easy to quantize. To reduce\nthe quantization error, we should increase the effective quan-\ntization bits for all the channels. The total effective quanti-\nzation bits would be largest when all the channels have the\nsame maximum magnitude. Therefore, a straight-forward\nchoice is sj= max( |Xj|), j= 1,2, ..., C i, where jcorre-\nsponds to j-th input channel. This choice ensures that after\nthe division, all the activation channels will have the same\nmaximum value, which is easy to quantize. Note that the\nrange of activations is dynamic; it varies for different input\nsamples. Here, we estimate the scale of activations channels\nusing calibration samples from the pre-training dataset (Ja-\ncob et al., 2018). However, this formula pushes allthe\nquantization difficulties to the weights. We find that, in this', 'branches. Here, we brieﬂy discuss each branch, and we\nrefer the interested readers to [197] for more details.\na) Quantization Error Minimization: The ﬁrst\nbranch of solutions aims to minimize the quantization\nerror, i.e., the gap between the real values and the\nquantized values [ 19,34,62,103,151,158,164,169,\n178,218,248]. Instead of using a single binary matrix\nto represent real-value weights/activations, HORQ [ 151]\nand ABC-Net [ 158] use a linear combination of multiple\nbinary matrices, i.e., W≈α1B1+···+αMBM, to\nreduce the quantization error. Inspired by the fact that\nbinarizing the activations reduces their representational\ncapability for the succeeding convolution block, [ 178]\nand [ 34] show that binarization of wider networks (i.e.,\nnetworks with larger number of ﬁlters) can achieve a\ngood trade-off between the accuracy and the model size.\nb) Improved Loss function: Another branch of\nworks focuses on the choice of loss function [ 48,98,', 'series of calibration inputs to compute the typical range\nof activations [ 113,267]. Multiple different metrics\nhave been proposed to ﬁnd the best range, including\nminimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) between original\nunquantized weight distribution and the corresponding\nquantized values [ 40,221,229,281]. One could also\nconsider using other metrics such as entropy [ 189],\nalthough MSE is the most common method used.

For Transformer models,\nweights and activations are usually represented in the\nform of tensors.

This limitation poses challenges when deploying generative artificial intelligence in real-world production environments.,RAG.pdf,b40c0db2f1,"Large language models (LLMs) often fail in real-world production environments due to limitations such as fabricating facts, lacking knowledge in specific domains or highly specialized queries, and failing to provide accurate answers when the information sought extends beyond the model's training data or requires the latest data.","['maintaining user privacy and data security are crucial con-\nsiderations when applying LLMs to real-world scenarios.\n9 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nIn this survey, we have reviewed the recent progress of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), and introduced the key concepts,\nfindings, and techniques for understanding and utilizing\nLLMs. We focus on the large-sized models ( i.e.,having a size\nlarger than 10B) while excluding the contents of early pre-\ntrained language models ( e.g., BERT and GPT-2) that have\nbeen well covered in the existing literature. In particular,our survey has discussed four important aspects of LLMs,\ni.e.,pre-training, adaptation, utilization, and evaluation. For\neach aspect, we highlight the techniques or findings that are\nkey to the success of LLMs. Furthermore, we also summa-\nrize the available resources for developing LLMs and dis-\ncuss important implementation guidelines for reproducing\nLLMs. This survey tries to cover the most recent literature', 'numerous shortcomings. They often fabricate\nfacts [Zhang et al. , 2023b ]and lack knowledge when\ndealing with specific domains or highly specialized\nqueries [Kandpal et al. , 2023 ]. For instance, when the infor-\nmation sought extends beyond the model’s training data or\nrequires the latest data, LLM may fail to provide accurate\nanswers. This limitation poses challenges when deploying\ngenerative artificial intelligence in real-world production\nenvironments, as blindly using a black-box LLM may not\nsuffice.\nTraditionally, neural networks adapt to specific domains\nor proprietary information by fine-tuning models to param-\neterize knowledge. While this technique yields significant\nresults, it demands substantial computational resources, in-\ncurs high costs, and requires specialized technical expertise,\nmaking it less adaptable to the evolving information land-\nscape. Parametric knowledge and non-parametric knowledge\nplay distinct roles. Parametric knowledge is acquired through', 'source ( intrinsic hallucination ) or cannot be verified by the\navailable source ( extrinsic hallucination ), which are illustrated\nby two examples in Figure 17. Hallucination widely occurs\nin existing LLMs, even the most superior LLMs such as\nGPT-4 [46]. Furthermore, existing work shows that LLMs\nencounter difficulties in recognizing the hallucinated con-\ntent in text [602], even the powerful ChatGPT. Additionally,beyond language tasks, a recent study has shown that large\nvision-language models (LVLM) also face challenges with\nhallucination, i.e.,generating objects that are not present in\nthe accompanying images [662]. In essence, LLMs seem\nto “unconsciously” utilize the knowledge in task solving,\nwhich still lack an ability to accurately control the use\nof internal or external knowledge. Hallucinations would\nmislead LLMs to generate undesired outputs and mostly\ndegrade the performance, leading to potential risks when\ndeploying LLMs in real-world applications. To alleviate', 'Further, it supports a number of language models such as\nGPT-2 and LLaMA, and also covers several representative\nvision Transformer models ( e.g.,ViT and Swin Transformer).\nAs discussed in Section 5.3.1, there have been a large\nnumber of efficient tuning methods proposed in the existing\nliterature. However, most of these approaches are tested\non small-sized pre-trained language models, instead of the\nLLMs. So far, there still lacks a thorough investigation on\nthe effect of different efficient tuning methods on large-sized\nlanguage models at different settings or tasks.\n5.4 Memory-Efficient Model Adaptation\nDue to the huge number of model parameters, LLMs take a\nsignificant memory footprint for inference, making it very\ncostly to be deployed in real-world applications. In this\nsection, we discuss how to reduce the memory footprint\nof LLMs via a popular model compression approach ( i.e.,\nmodel quantization), so that large-sized LLMs can be used', 'reconstruction problem rely on heavy computation of second-order Hessian inverses, which do not\nscale to the large hidden state size of LLMs. SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) develops an\nefficient weight update procedure for LLMs via synchronized second-order Hessian updates.\nEmergent Properties of LLMs. Our work is also related to recent studies on the existence of large\nmagnitude outlier features in large language models (Kovaleva et al., 2021; Bondarenko et al., 2021;\nTimkey & Schijndel, 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Puccetti et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b).

Cobra[13] integrates DINOv2[76] and SigLIP[75] as its vision backbone,\nwith the rationale that merging the low-level spatial features from DINOv2 and the semantic at-\ntributes offered by SigLIP will enhance performance on subsequent tasks. SPHINX-X[14] employs\ntwo vision encoders – DINOv2 and CLIP-ConvNeXt. Given that these models have been pre-trained\nvia distinct learning methodologies (self-supervised versus weakly supervised) and network archi-\ntectures (ViT versus CNN), they are naturally capable of offering the most complementary and\nsophisticated visual knowledge.\nLightweight Vision Encoder Vision Transformer architectures in real-world applications pose\nchallenges due to hardware and environmental limitations, including processing power and compu-\ntational capabilities. ViTamin [11] represents a lightweight vision model, specifically tailored for\nvision and language models. It commences with a convolutional stem, succeeded by Mobile Con-', 'Figure 5: MobileVLM v2 [17] and Honeybee [19] efficient vision-language projector.\n2.3 Small Language Model\nThe pre-trained small language model(SLM) serves as the core component of MLLMs, endowing\nit with many outstanding capabilities, such as zero-shot generalization, instruction following, and\nin-context learning. The SLM accepts input sequences containing multiple modalities and outputs\ncorresponding text sequences. A text tokenizer is typically bundled with the SLM, mapping text\nprompts Xqto the text tokens Hq. The text tokens Hqand the visual tokens Hvare concatenated as\nthe input of the language model, which outputs the final response sequence Yain an autoregressive\nmanner:\np(Ya|Hv, Hq) =LY\ni=1p(yi|Hv, Hq, y<i), (3)\nwhere Ldenotes the length of Ya. As the SLM contributes the vast majority of MLLM parameters,\nits selection is closely related to the lightweight nature of MLLM. In comparison to conventional', 'ment between the feature spaces of visual and text inputs. Since the vision encoder constitutes a\nrelatively minor portion of the MLLM parameters, the advantages of lightweight optimization are\nless pronounced compared to the language model. Therefore, efficient MLLMs generally continue\nto employ visual encoders that are widely used in large-scale MLLMs, as detailed in Table 1.\nMultiple Vision Encoders BRA VE[12] in Figure. 4 performs an extensive ablation of various vi-\nsion encoders with distinct inductive biases for tackling MLMM tasks. The results indicate that there\nisn’t a single-encoder setup that consistently excels across different tasks, and encoders with diverse\nbiases can yield surprisingly similar results. Presumably, incorporating multiple vision encoders\ncontributes to capturing a wide range of visual representations, thereby enhancing the model’s com-\nprehension of visual data.

This section introduces two key technologies to\nachieve this goal.\nQuery Rewrite\nThe most intuitive way to align the semantics of\nquery and document is to rewrite the query. As\nmentioned in Query2Doc [Wang et al. , 2023b ]and ITER-\nRETGEN [Shao et al. , 2023 ], the inherent capabilities of\nlarge language models are utilized to generate a pseudo-\ndocument by guiding it, and then the original query is\nmerged with this pseudo-document to form a new query.\nIn HyDE [Gao et al. , 2022 ], query vectors are established\nthrough the use of text indicators, using these indicators to\ngenerate a ’hypothetical’ document that is relevant, yet may\nnot truly exist, it only needs to capture the relevant pattern.\nRRR [Maet al. , 2023a ]introduced a new framework that in-\nverts the order of retrieval and reading, focusing on query\nrewriting. This method generates a query using a large lan-', 'different scenarios, including using query engines pro-\nvided by frameworks like LlamaIndex, employing tree\nqueries, utilizing vector queries, or employing the most\nbasic sequential querying of chunks.•HyDE: This approach is grounded on the assumption\nthat the generated answers may be closer in the embed-\nding space than a direct query. Utilizing LLM, HyDE\ngenerates a hypothetical document (answer) in response\nto a query, embeds the document, and employs this em-\nbedding to retrieve real documents similar to the hypo-\nthetical one. In contrast to seeking embedding similarity\nbased on the query, this method emphasizes the embed-\nding similarity from answer to answer. However, it may\nnot consistently yield favorable results, particularly in\ninstances where the language model is unfamiliar with\nthe discussed topic, potentially leading to an increased\ngeneration of error-prone instances.\nModular RAG\nThe modular RAG structure breaks away from the traditional', 'cross-attention scores, selecting the highest scoring input to-\nkens to effectively filter tokens. RECOMP [Xuet al. , 2023a ]\nproposes extractive and generative compressors, which gen-\nerate summaries by selecting relevant sentences or syn-\nthesizing document information to achieve multi-document\nquery focus summaries.In addition to that, a novel approach,\nPKG [Luoet al. , 2023 ], infuses knowledge into a white-box\nmodel through directive fine-tuning, and directly replaces the\nretriever module, used to directly output relevant documents\nbased on the query.\n5 Generator\nAnother core component in RAG is the generator, responsible\nfor transforming retrieved information into natural and fluent\ntext. Its design is inspired by traditional language models,\nbut in comparison to conventional generative models, RAG’s\ngenerator enhances accuracy and relevance by leveraging the\nretrieved information.

This approach\nenables the RAG system to adapt to different query types\nand information needs, ensuring consistent retrieval of\nthe most relevant and context-rich information. Hybrid\nsearch serves as a robust complement to retrieval strate-\ngies, enhancing the overall performance of the RAG\npipeline.\n•Recursive Retrieval and Query Engine: Another pow-\nerful method to optimize retrieval in the RAG system\ninvolves implementing recursive retrieval and a sophis-\nticated query engine.

During inference,\neven if the given image does not contain a person, the model still tends to predict the presence\nof a person.

This reduction in preci-\nsion aims to decrease memory usage, computational complexity, and energy consumption while\npreserving model accuracy to an acceptable level. Current research can be mainly categorized into\npost-training quantization, quantization-aware training, and hardware-aware quantization.\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) compresses trained ViT models by converting their param-\neters from high-precision floating-point numbers to lower-precision fixed-point numbers, such as\n8-bit integers. For example, Liu et al.

Similar to traditional VLMs training, as exemplified by CLIP [ 88], web-scale image-\ntext pairs [ 92] are utilized for training. Given that the final output is at the LLM side, the most\nwidely used loss function in this stage is the text generation loss, typically cross-entropy loss, which\naligns with the pre-training of LLMs. Certain studies (e.g., [ 22,66]) explore the incorporation of\ncontrastive loss and image-text matching loss to further enhance alignment.

Currently, there are five\nmain strategies employed for this purpose: increasing\nthe granularity of indexed data, optimizing index struc-\ntures, adding metadata, alignment optimization, and\nmixed retrieval.\n1.Enhancing Data Granularity: The objective of\npre-index optimization is to improve text standard-\nization, consistency, and ensure factual accuracy\nand contextual richness to guarantee the perfor-\nmance of the RAG system. Text standardization in-\nvolves removing irrelevant information and special\ncharacters to enhance the efficiency of the retriever.\nIn terms of consistency, the primary task is to elim-\ninate ambiguity in entities and terms, along with']","['ba4f3a6fe9', 'cd69a480bb', '5e50b58781', 'cda379cb44', '8a71abd00a']",crossencoder,text,1.0,1

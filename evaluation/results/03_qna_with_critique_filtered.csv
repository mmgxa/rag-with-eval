Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate pow-
erful capabilities, but they still face challenges in
practical applications, such as hallucinations, slow
knowledge updates, and lack of transparency in
answers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
refers to the retrieval of relevant information from
external knowledge bases before answering ques-
tions with LLMs. RAG has been demonstrated
to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce
model hallucination, particularly for knowledge-
intensive tasks. By citing sources, users can verify","How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improve the performance of large language models?
","RAG improves the performance of large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases before answering questions, which enhances answer accuracy, reduces model hallucination, and is particularly beneficial for knowledge-intensive tasks.",RAG.pdf,5,"Upon reviewing the provided response, it is evident that the answer is directly tied to the query about Retrieval-Augmented Generation's impact on large language models. The response outlines the core concept of RAG and explains its benefits, such as enhancing answer accuracy, reducing model hallucination, and providing transparency in answers. Moreover, the response does not veer off-topic or provide information that is unrelated to the question asked. This indicates that the answer is well-grounded in the context of the question and requires no further interpretation.

Furthermore, the response is articulate and coherent, effectively communicating the complex ideas behind RAG and its benefits.

In the RAG model, the optimization of the generator is a cru-
cial component of the architecture. The generator’s task is
to take the retrieved information and generate relevant text,
thereby providing the final output of the model. The goal of
optimizing the generator is to ensure that the generated text is
both natural and effectively utilizes the retrieved documents,
in order to better satisfy the user’s query needs.
In typical Large Language Model (LLM) generation tasks,
the input is usually a query. In RAG, the main difference
lies in the fact that the input includes not only a query
but also various documents retrieved by the retriever (struc-

Compact Architecture refers to the design of lightweight and efficient models while maintaining high

These strategies can be broadly categorized into three categories, 1) Architecture Design Methods,

Architecture Design Methods involve creating new architectures [133] or adjusting existing
ones [134] to achieve compactness without sacrificing performance. For example, Reformer [96]

multiple paragraphs simultaneously, performing fragment-

Additionally, it acknowledges the TruLens library as an open-source solution for this problem.

However, the response could have provided more clarity on how these techniques work in practice and how they relate to the RAG framework.

HaELM focuses on the detection of hallucinations using large language models, a topic that is specific and technical. It provides a thorough explanation of how HaELM operates, outlining the training process and the utilization of image descriptions for evaluation. This suggests a strong connection to the context provided by the instruction. 

FaithScore, on the other hand, focuses on the evaluation of responses to open-ended questions, which is more general and could potentially apply to various contexts. The explanation of the descriptive sub-sentence process and the breakdown into three evaluation steps shows an attempt to provide clarity and directness in the answer.

Indexing
The pipeline for obtaining data from the source and building
an index for it generally occurs in an offline state. Specifi-
cally, the construction of a data index involves the following
steps:1.Data Indexing: This involves cleaning and extracting the
original data, converting different file formats such as PDF,
HTML, Word, Markdown, etc., into plain text.
2.Chunking: This involves dividing the loaded text into
smaller chunks. This is necessary because language mod-
els typically have a limit on the amount of context they can
handle, so it is necessary to create as small text chunks as
possible.
3. Embedding and Creating Index: This is the process of
encoding text into vectors through a language model. The re-

to calculate the similarity between the vector and the problem

"are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix,
i.e.,MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens rather than all
the previous tokens. Such a partial over-trust inclination results in neglecting image tokens and
describing the image content with hallucination. Based on this observation, a decoding method for
MLLMs grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection- Allocation strategy is proposed.
First, a penalty term on the model logits is introduced during the MLLM beam-search decoding
process to mitigate the over-trust issue. Additionally, to handle the hard cases that cannot be
addressed by the penalty term, a more aggressive strategy called the rollback strategy is proposed
to retrospect the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens and reallocate
the token selection if necessary.

•Attribute. The object categories identified by MLLMs are accurate, while the descriptions of
these objects’ attributes (such as color, shape, material, content, counting, action, etc.) are
wrong. In Fig. 3, ""pink blossoms"" is hallucinated by the MLLM as the color is inaccurate.
•Relation. All objects and their attributes are described correctly, but the relationships among
them (such as human-object interactions or relative positions) do not align with the actual
image content. In Fig. 3, ""...standing around her, watching..."" is a typical example of relation
hallucination, as the objects are presented in the image but the relation is inaccurate.
It’s worth noting that some literature may categorize objects counting, objects event, etc., as

In the past year, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demon-
strated remarkable performance in tasks such as visual question answering, vi-
sual understanding and reasoning. However, the extensive model size and high
training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs
in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs
has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of effi-
cient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative effi-
cient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the appli-","Which area of application has potential for efficient Multimodal Large Language Models?

1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) [ 29,81,85,99,132] has dominated a wide
range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP), achieving unprecedented progress in language
understanding [ 39,47], generation [ 128,140] and reasoning [ 20,58,87,107,115]. Leveraging
the capabilities of robust LLMs, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [ 22,75,111,138],
sometimes referred to as large vision-language models (LVLMs), are attracting increasing attention.
MLLMs show promising ability in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning [ 66], visual question
answering [ 22,75], etc. However, there is a concerning trend associated with the rapid advancement
in MLLMs. These models exhibit an inclination to generate hallucinations [ 69,76,137], resulting in
seemingly plausible yet factually spurious content.
The problem of hallucination originates from LLMs themselves. In the NLP community, the","What is the issue associated with the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models?

"the semantic space of the user’s query and documents is very
necessary. This section introduces two key technologies to
achieve this goal.
Query Rewrite
The most intuitive way to align the semantics of
query and document is to rewrite the query. As
mentioned in Query2Doc [Wang et al. , 2023b ]and ITER-
RETGEN [Shao et al. , 2023 ], the inherent capabilities of
large language models are utilized to generate a pseudo-
document by guiding it, and then the original query is
merged with this pseudo-document to form a new query.
In HyDE [Gao et al. , 2022 ], query vectors are established
through the use of text indicators, using these indicators to
generate a ’hypothetical’ document that is relevant, yet may
not truly exist, it only needs to capture the relevant pattern.

verts the order of retrieval and reading, focusing on query
rewriting. This method generates a query using a large lan-","How does HyDE generate a hypothetical document relevant to the query?

The response references relevant studies like Query2Doc, ITER-RETGEN, and RRR, which solidifies the answer's context. It effectively articulates the process of query rewrite and the generation of a pseudo-document by using text indicators. However, the explanation could be more concise and less verbose to improve readability.

The provided context guides the response well, although there could have been an attempt to further clarify the technology used by HyDE. For example, more detailed examples of the technologies could have enhanced the answer's relevance. Despite this, the response successfully identifies key technologies and methodologies used by HyDE to create a hypothetical document, which aligns with the scoring criteria for a score of 4. 

Therefore, while the response offers valuable information, it could benefit from further simplification and additional context to improve its clarity and directness. The response is overall relevant and informative but could have made better use of the available context.

"paradigm in biomedicine, achieving state-of-the-art results on many applications, including medical
question answering [194] and medical image classification [195]. Recently, multimodal generative
AI has emerged as an exciting frontier in the biomedical domain, expanding the application scope
from single-modality to multi-modality, such as VQA and radiology report generation.
The mixture of Expert Tuning has effectively enhanced the performance of general MLLMs with
fewer parameters, yet its application in resource-limited medical settings has not been fully explored.
MoE-TinyMed [64] is a model tailored for medical applications that significantly lower parameter

The first part of the response introduces some general ideas about advancements in the biomedical field, which, while informative, are not directly relevant to the question. This digression could be seen as an overestimation of the context provided by the question. 

The second part of the response is well-focused on the question's requirement, mentioning MoE-TinyMed and LLaV A-Rad as models tailored for medical applications with lower parameter demands. This directly addresses the question's intent, showing a strong connection to the context. 

Moreover, the response concludes by mentioning the modular approach and integration of unimodal pre-trained models, which is relevant to the question's focus on models that significantly lower parameter demands. 

Despite these strengths, the response falls short in providing a direct, succinct answer to the question as it contains some extraneous information about the broader field of biomedicine. These additional details, while potentially interesting, do not contribute directly to answering the question. 

In light of these considerations, the response demonstrates an understanding of the question's context, but there is a slight lack of focus and conciseness. Therefore, the score is 4, as the response is mostly grounded and clear with minimal interpretation from the context.

"dataset has strong effects on the behavior of the model. Frequently appeared objects and object
co-occurrence are two prominent types of statistical bias, as discussed in [ 69,90,137]. For example,
‘person ’ might be one of the most frequently appearing objects in the training data. During inference,
even if the given image does not contain a person, the model still tends to predict the presence
of a person. On the other hand, object co-occurrence refers to the phenomenon that the model
will remember which two objects usually ‘go together’ [ 90]. For instance, given an image of a
kitchen with a refrigerator, MLLMs are prone to answer ‘ Yes’ when asked about a microwave, as
refrigerators and microwaves frequently appear together in kitchen scenes. Bias exists in most
datasets. Increasing the scale of data may alleviate the effect, but cannot fully resolve it, given the
long-tail distribution of the real world.

cessitating intricate recognition, including crowd counting and OCR of small characters. A direct
approach to address these challenges involves increasing the image resolution, practically, the num-
ber of visual tokens. This strategy, nonetheless, imposes a substantial computational burden on
MLLMs, primarily due to the quadratic scaling of computational costs with the number of input to-
kens in the Transformer architecture. Motivated by this challenge, vision token compression, aimed
to reduce the prohibitive computation budget caused by numerous tokens, has become an essential
aspect of efficient MLLMs. We will explore this topic through several key techniques, including

However, there are areas where more explicit connections to the provided context could have been made to strengthen the answer's relevance. The explanation of the ""motivated by this challenge"" statement, for instance, could have been more explicit in tying the vision token compression directly to the challenges of tasks like crowd counting and OCR.

"samples) and hallucinatory descriptions (negative samples). HA-DPO then trains the model using
these sample pairs, enabling it to distinguish between accurate and hallucinatory descriptions. This
goal is achieved through direction preference optimization (DPO), which optimizes a specific loss
function designed to maximize the model’s preference for positive samples while minimizing its
preference for negative samples.
A concurrent work, Silkie [ 68], introduces a similar approach of utilizing preference-based
reinforcement learning to enhance the faithfulness of MLLMs. Specifically, it emphasizes the
concept of reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) by distilling preferences from a more
robust MLLM, i.e., GPT-4V [ 83]. Responses are first generated by models from 12 MLLMs, and then
assessed by GPT-4V. The constructed dataset, termed as VLFeedback, contains preferences distilled
from GPT-4V and is utilized to train other MLLMs through direct preference optimization.","What is the name of the concurrent work that also uses preference-based reinforcement learning to improve the faithfulness of MLLMs?

It details how the concurrent work, HA-DPO, utilizes preference-based reinforcement learning to improve the faithfulness of MLLMs. The explanation of the use of positive and negative sample pairs and the optimization through DPO is clear and directly related to the instruction. Additionally, the introduction of Silkie and its method of training MLLMs through RLAIF and preference optimization gives a complete picture of the topic.

However, there's a slight ambiguity when referring to ""VLLFeedback"", which could be misinterpreted as a specific feedback method, rather than a dataset used for training other MLLMs. This introduces a minor distraction from the core focus of the response, which should be on the reinforcement learning aspect of the concurrent work.

Despite this, the answer remains mostly grounded, providing a relevant and clear explanation that aligns well with the provided context. Therefore, it fulfills most of the criteria laid out in the score rubric, making it a strong response overall.

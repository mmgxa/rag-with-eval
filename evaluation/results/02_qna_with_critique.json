However, it deviates from the central query, discussing adaptive state models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning instead of directly addressing the role of adapter-based tuning in the context of large language models. The response does mention some key points like the complexity of the model and the importance of fine-tuning, but these are presented without clear connections to the context of the question. While it provides relevant information, it lacks the direct and focused answer expected from a score 5 response according to the score rubric. It fails to base the response clearly and directly on the provided context, which is the core requirement for this task. The lack of clarity in tying the response to the specific query posed in the instruction detracts from its overall quality. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 2 or 3. \n[RESULT] 2", "id": "0e48bbbaa3"}, {"context": "code generation tasks (Zhou et al., 2023) by retrieving from\ncoding documents.Foundation models are completion models, which have lim-\nited chat and instruction following capabilities.

However, it continues to describe a series of model alignment techniques, including instruction fine-tuning and RLHF, which are relevant to the question. The response also discusses alternative methods like DPO and SteerLM, but these are not explained in relation to the complexity reduction aspect of the question. Additionally, the response seems to overemphasize the comparison between different methods rather than focusing solely on reducing complexity and resource intensity of RLHF. While the response touches on key aspects related to the model alignment process, it lacks depth in its explanation, particularly in terms of the direct impact of each method on the complexity and resource intensity.
